Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Block elements typically cause a line break to occur, inline elements do not force a new line. You cannot
    put block elements inside inline elements.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    An element with position: absolute is removed from the normal document flow. It's positioned automatically to the
    top left corner of it's parent element, and if it doesn't have a parent element then the initial document will be it's
    parent.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    .boxModel {
        width: 200px;
    }

    Enter in whatever px you'd like.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    DISPLAY BOX: 1. <p>
                 2. <address>
                 3. <div>
    DISPLAY INLINE: 1. <span>
                    2. <display>
                    3. <a>
    DISPLAY INLINE-BLOCK: 1. <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    The box model is the fundamental concept for the composition of web pages. It gives block-level elements such a <p> a width
    and a height and three levels of boxes surrounding it: padding, borders and margins. The height and width refers to the
    actual dimensions, the padding is the space between this content and the border of the box, the border is any kind of line
    surrounding the box and the margin is the space around the border.
